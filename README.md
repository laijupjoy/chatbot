## Summary

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Service is use for data annotation purpose. Here using a Common Annotation Framework (CAF) managed with Ground Truth service. 
When annotation task performing in CAF, logs will be create and stores information about the steps of Common Annotation Workflow. With the logs information, 
you can create data annotation regulatory reports, it will help to establish data annotation governance and audit standards.


## Motivation

### Why are we doing this?

As our data annotation regulatory report generation will be more easier and and different parameters about data annotation we need to make sure the content is accessible and evaluate.

### What is the expected outcome

We shall be able to answer following questions as a conclusion

- Explain the process of labeling job in annotation workflow

- What are the information available in log file

- How many number of data are labelled

- What is the labeling job name mentioned in log file

- Where stored the input data configuration of labeling job

- Where stored the output data configuration of labeling job

### Understand the existing annotation workflow

Data Annotation Workflow Diagram

This diagram shows the existing annotation workflow.Here, the SageMaker client call an API for schedule annotation job, API passing 
labeling job name into the workflow. After that, annotator will receive the call for initiate annotation and tools allocate for annotation job will
be enabled.After complete the annotation, result will be store in S3 buckets

### Explore the logs output by CAF

Here, we explore the logs output generated by CAF by using call the function `describe_labeling_job()` in SageMaker service. It will gets information 
about a labeling job.

The syntax of this function is

````
response = client.describe_labeling_job(
    LabelingJobName='string'
)
````

Parameter in describe_labeling_job() function is `LabelingJobName` is a string value.

The `labeling job` return information is

Here, we explore CloudWatch Logs also generated by CAF by using call the function `get_log_events()`. It will lists log events from the specified log stream.

The syntax of this function is

````
response = client.get_log_events(
    logGroupName='string',
    logStreamName='string',
    startTime=123,
    endTime=123,
    nextToken='string',
    limit=123,
    startFromHead=True|False
)
````

The `get log events` return information is
